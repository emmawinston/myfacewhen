A local multiplayer game commissioned by [Now Play This 2019](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/now-play-this-2019).

See https://emmawinston.me/2019/04/08/project-my-face-when/ for an explanation, https://emmawinston.me/myfacewhen/ for the application as displayed onsite. Requires Chrome.

Note that this was built as a site-specific installation, and the zoom level will be incorrect on all but a 1920x1080 display; you can zoom out, but this seems to affect behaviour and performance unpredictably. You will also need four gamepad controllers connected over USB to play properly. Please consider this an unsupported project, made public for the sake of interest!
